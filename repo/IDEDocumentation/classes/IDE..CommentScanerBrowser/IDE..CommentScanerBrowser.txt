The comment scanner can be used by importing old tcl/xotcl source to XOTclIDE.
The problem is that # comments that are written before method are class
headers are lost be loading (source) scripts.
XOTclIDE use @ (metacommand) for specifing comments (see xotcl documentation).
This tool read scripts and extraxt # comments to internal XOTclIDE comments.
