Helper class for tracking new classes
by package loading.

The tracker can recognize the new created classes and tcl-procs.
No all informations are computed yet. The tracker do not know
witch instproc and procs are defined in each package (this information are
sended to componet and ignored in it).
So all methods belong to package where the object were defined.
